# AntiRPG

A not-really-RPG-but-actually dungeon crawler based on the crappy "learn how to program" framework called "Greenfoot" (we didn't have a choice).
In retrospect, I'd estimate 2/3 of our work was to work around said framework and implement stuff of which a good framework should have take care off.
You control a player in a dungeon and have to kill the boss monster, other monsters you kill get you bonus points. The boss monster is the one with the red pants, it shoots powerful fireballs at you and walks in your direction - if it touchs you, it hurts. The basic monsters have white pants for one which shoots fireballs but walks really slowly and brown pants for one which can't shoot, but walks in your direction
The player is a powerful mage, but sadly absolutely useless at close combat - it /does/ damage, but not enough to really count, we wouldn't recommend it.
You move the player with the arrow keys and turn around with the v and b keys to turn left and right respectively. You don't need to face in the direction you move to, but you'll shoot in that direction when you hit space.

## To do:
* Decorations (well, they should get images, otherwise they don't really contribute to the game)
* Migrate to a real engine as the deadline has passed anyway (godot? seems pretty decent and it's cross platform. Or maybe something of our own, would be a nice challenge but not really results oriented. Or maybe we should just leave it.)
