# AntiRPG

A not-really-RPG based on a crappy "learn how to program" framework forced on us by our teacher.
In retrospect, I'd estimate 2/3 of our work was to work around said framework and implement stuff of which a good framework should have take care off.

## To do:
* Decorations (well, they should get images, otherwise they don't really contribute to the game)
* Migrate to a real engine as the deadline has passed anyway (godot? seems pretty decent and it's cross platform. Or maybe something of our own, would be a nice challenge but not really results oriented)
